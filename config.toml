Hi there! I am Jennifer (张诗悦). I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). My research examines strategic message design and effects in digital environments, with applications across advertising, health, science, and environmental communication. The central question driving my work is "How does strategic messaging influence brand perceptions and public understanding of complex issues related to health, science, and environment?”

At UIUC, I have taught a variety of undergraduate courses, including *Audience Analysis*, *Advertising Research Methods*, *Advertising and Brand Strategy*, and *Introduction to Advertising*.

Before academia, I worked in the advertising industry for a music streaming startup and media publishers in Shanghai and Beijing, leading public relations campaigns, new media content creation, and integrated communication strategies.

When I'm not teaching or researching, I enjoy spending time in nature and immersing myself in outdoor activities. If you can't reach me during non-business hours, I'm probably trekking somewhere with spectacularly bad cell service…like, Everest Base Camp.
