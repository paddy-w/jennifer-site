      In teaching, I aim to cultivate students to think critically, apply theory to practice, and enter the communication industry with confidence. To achieve this, I focus on three pedagogical strategies: 1) following a WHAT–WHY–HOW structure to deliver clear and effective classes; 2) emphasizing student-centered learning to address diverse needs; and 3) building rapport to cultivate an inclusive, caring, and welcoming classroom environment.

      To maximize the clarity and effectiveness of the learning experience, I structure each course with clear organization. At the beginning of class, I outline the agenda and learning objectives, guide students through concepts with ample examples, and end with a recap. For example, in Advertising Research Methods (ADV 281), I introduce statistical concepts by explaining the context that necessitates a specific test (WHAT), followed by practical examples using analytic software to reinforce understanding (WHY), and demonstrate how these methods can be applied beyond the classroom (HOW). I reserve the last twenty minutes for students to independently run analyses using software and report results using real-world data. After quizzes, I review commonly missed questions to clarify misunderstandings before moving on. I view teaching effectiveness as more than achieving high grades; rather, it means students acquire practical skills they can apply in their careers. In Advertising and Brand Strategy (ADV 283), for instance, I replaced traditional group discussions with mock pitch presentations, allowing students to present as if they were in an agency setting. This practice boosted engagement and sharpened their presentation skills, thereby directly benefiting their professional development.

      I prioritize a student-centered learning experience by integrating materials that align with students' interests. To better accommodate student needs, I conduct a pre-semester survey to gather information on their media consumption habits and brand preferences. This helps me tailor examples to their interests. When teaching Audience Analysis (ADV 483) as the instructor of record, for instance, I updated a comScore Demographic Profile example from Lululemon to Apple, since nearly half the class indicated Apple as their favorite brand. I also allow students to choose brands they are passionate about for individual assignments when exploring the functions of the comScore Plan Metrix platform, ensuring in-class activities connect with career-relevant skills.

      Given the diverse backgrounds of my students, I strive to create an inclusive and supportive environment. I prioritize remembering students' names and their preferred names to make them feel welcome and comfortable in my class. I am available to my students: I arrive to class early and stay after class for discussion and questions, and I encourage students to visit me at office hours, viewing them as a valuable opportunity to foster rapport. Recognizing that not all students are comfortable speaking up in class, I also maintain an anonymous feedback form where they can ask questions or share thoughts about specific lectures or the course overall. This practice has proven effective in fostering continuous improvement and responsive teaching.

      My teaching philosophy continues to develop through student interaction, mentorship, and ongoing reflection. I regularly adapt my strategies based on both formal and informal feedback. Beyond classroom instruction, I have mentored fourteen undergraduate and graduate students on literature reviews, data collection, and data analysis across multiple research projects. I have also taken the Inclusive Pedagogy for Media (ADV 590), which deepened my understanding of equitable teaching practices and further prepared me to be an inclusive, effective media educator capable of guiding students' independent learning."
